  <p>The internet is arguably the 20th century’s greatest technological achievement, and I’m excited to be a small part of the power behind it. Today, I’m an innovative IT professional with Web Development & Design skills, paired with senior level experience in Business Analysis and Systems Analysis. My Web Development skills use the latest Full Stack Development tools.  I am skilled in bridging the gap between business and technical stakeholders. I offer a unique mix of technical and business skill sets to add value to the bottom line.</p>
  <br>
  <p>But it wasn’t always so…</p>
  <br>
  <p>Rewind back to 1995, when I left a great job in advertising to go backpacking. While I was traveling across the Southern Hemisphere I was frustrated trying to receive snail mail from friends and family back in Canada. In my travels, I stumbled across a new service called <em>Hotmail</em> (!) That discovery was life changing.
  In 1999, I embarked on a technology career path, and I haven’t looked back since. From help desk positions to Senior Business Analyst roles, my IT career has been very rewarding. Yet still, the simple idea of being able to retrieve and send mail from any computer with a one-line address intigues me to this day.</p>
  <br>
  I'm excited to show off this portfolio and links to other work I have done. Please have a look at my <a href="resume.html">resum&eacute;</a>, it also contains links to other websites I have written, as well as my GitHub repositories and linkedIn presence. Thanks for visiting!</p>
