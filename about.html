  <p>The Internet is perhaps the 20th century’s greatest technological achievement. I am excited to be a member of an industry that makes that technology available to everyone, every day. Today, I’m an innovative IT professional with Web Development & Design skills, paired with senior level experience in Business Analysis and Systems Analysis. My Web Development skills use the latest Full Stack Development tools.  I am skilled in bridging the gap between business and technical stakeholders. I offer a unique mix of technical and business skill sets to add value to the bottom line. But it wasn’t always so…</p>
  <p>In 1999, I left my advertising sales job to pursue a new career in IT. I haven’t looked back since. From a Junior Help Desk position to Senior Business Analyst roles and a few titles in between, my IT career has been very rewarding so far.</p>
  <p>I'm excited to show off this portfolio and links to other work I have done. Please also have a look at my <a href="resume.html">resum&eacute;</a>. The resum&eacute; contains links to other websites I have developed, as well as my GitHub repositories and linkedIn presence. Thanks for visiting!</p>
